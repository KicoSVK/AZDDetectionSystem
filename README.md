This project present a system coined as <b>ADEROS (Artificial Intelligence-based Detection System for Road Security)</b> which combines detection and classification methods focusing on various image processing inputs which include vehicle trajectory tracking, light signalling systems, vehicle and pedestrian presence, railway barriers at railway crossings, and railway warnings. The presented system is based on a camera module that is suitably positioned to capture an entire scene. The module uses Graphics Processing Units (GPU) for accelerated image processing techniques and deep neural networks to detect dangerous situations in various road and level crossing situations.
